### PLUM Repository Class 

The code in this directory allows the user to create a Repository object. They can then use the Repository object to run any of the functions defined in the `plum_functions` sub-directory.

The Repository object takes a path to a github repo, clones it, initializes the environment and uses source parser to get the parsed information for all the focal functions in the repo.
